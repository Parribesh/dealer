# Multiplayer Turn-Based Card Game

This project is a multiplayer turn-based card game using a **Go backend** and a **JavaScript frontend**. The game will have a real-time interaction feature, with a WebSocket-based backend to handle player actions and state synchronization.

---

## Project Overview

### **Tech Stack**:
- **Backend**: Go
  - WebSocket for real-time game actions
  - REST API for initial game state
- **Frontend**: JavaScript (or React, optional)
  - WebSocket integration for real-time updates
  - HTML/CSS for UI and animations

---

### **Backend**:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Go dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy

### **Issues**:
   1. Frontend sucks, should work on that one
   2. When a card is played, the card is still in hand, should take that one off. 

## **Currently Working **:
 1. getting the card off the hand
