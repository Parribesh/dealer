Architecture Overview
Frontend (JavaScript / React)
    Purpose: The frontend will handle the user interface, including the card game board, player actions, and interaction with the backend via WebSockets and REST API.
    Key Components:
    Card Display: Dynamic rendering of cards in the player's hand and on the game board.
    Game Board: A visual representation of the game state, including player stats (e.g., health, cards in play).
    WebSocket Communication: Communicates with the backend for real-time updates, such as player actions and state changes.
    REST API Integration: Used to retrieve the initial game state, card decks, and other one-time data.
Backend (Go)
    Purpose: The backend manages the game logic, user authentication, game state, and communication between players using WebSockets.
    Key Components:
    WebSocket Server: Manages real-time communication for player actions and game state synchronization.
    Game State Manager: Tracks the state of the game (whose turn, card positions, player health, etc.).
    Card System: Defines the card attributes and handles player actions like drawing cards, playing cards, etc.
    Authentication & Matchmaking: Handles JWT-based player authentication and pairs players into matches.
    REST API: Provides initial game data like player stats, card decks, etc., via HTTP endpoints.
    Game Logic: Implements rules for turns, actions, and victory conditions.
Communication Layer
    Purpose: Manages communication between the frontend and backend, ensuring real-time gameplay.
    Key Components:
    WebSocket Protocol: Used for real-time communication, sending and receiving messages for player actions and game state updates.
    REST API: Used for initial game setup (e.g., retrieving the deck of cards, player info).


Component Breakdown

    1. Frontend (JavaScript / React)
        Card UI: Each card is represented as a UI component. Cards can be clicked, dragged, or selected for playing.

        Properties: Attack, Defense, Special Abilities, Cost, etc.
        States: "In Hand", "On Board", "Discarded".
        Game Board: Represents both players’ hands and their cards on the battlefield.

        Player UI: Displays player stats, such as health, mana, or any other resource needed to play cards.
        Turn Management: Displays whose turn it is and allows players to end their turn.
        Communication:

        WebSocket Handling: Manages sending and receiving messages to/from the server.
        REST API: Used for initial game setup (e.g., fetching card deck and player data).
    2. Backend (Go)
        Game Server (WebSocket-based):

        A WebSocket server will handle real-time communication between players and the server.
        It will manage game events like "play card", "end turn", "draw card", etc., and broadcast these updates to connected players.
        Game Logic:

        Implements game rules, such as how cards interact (e.g., attacks, defenses, spell effects).
        Handles turn-based mechanics and victory conditions.
        Game State Manager:

        Stores the current state of the game (cards in play, cards in hand, player health, whose turn, etc.).
        Updates the state based on player actions and broadcasts updates to both players.
        Player Management:

        Authentication: Handles JWT-based login and validation.
        Matchmaking: Pairs players into games, either randomly or based on some criteria (e.g., ranking).
        REST API:

        Exposes endpoints for actions like starting a new game, getting available cards, or checking player stats.
        Example Endpoints:
        /api/game/start: Starts a new game and returns initial game state.
        /api/player/stats: Returns player stats (e.g., health, win/loss ratio).
    3. Communication Layer
        WebSocket Protocol:
        Frontend and backend will use WebSocket communication for real-time gameplay.
        Key events:
        play_card: Sent when a player plays a card.
        end_turn: Sent when a player ends their turn.
        update_state: Sent when the game state changes (e.g., after a card is played).
        REST API:
        Primarily used to get initial game data like player stats, card decks, etc.
        Game state will be persisted through WebSocket messages, but initial states are fetched via REST API.


****************** Main Game Logic **********************
Sequence Diagram
    Here’s a high-level sequence of interactions in the game:

    Frontend Initialization:

    User logs in and is authenticated via JWT.
    The frontend requests the initial game state via a REST API (/api/game/start).
    Game Start:

    The backend initializes the game, dealing cards to both players and setting the game state.
    The game state is returned via REST API, and WebSocket connection is established.
    Real-Time Gameplay:

    Player 1 plays a card.
    The card play event is sent to the backend via WebSocket.
    The backend processes the action and updates the game state.
    The new game state is broadcast to both players via WebSocket.
    Player 2 receives the updated game state and their UI updates.
    Turn End:

    When a player ends their turn, the backend updates the turn state and notifies the next player to begin.
